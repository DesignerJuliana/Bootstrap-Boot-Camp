# Bootstrap-Boot-Camp
A project I did with a YouTube video instruction.
The idea was to integrate css and javascript Bootstrap files and learn how to develop layouts, including navigation, side-by-side layouts, 3-column layouts, and more for each section of the webpage.
Also included is a modal, when you click on the "Start the Enrollment" link.
